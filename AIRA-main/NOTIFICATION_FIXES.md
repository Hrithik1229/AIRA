# Notification System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

The notification system had several critical issues that have been resolved:

### 1. **No Centralized Service**

- **Problem**: Notifications were scattered across components with inconsistent implementation
- **Solution**: Created a centralized `NotificationService` class that handles all notification logic

### 2. **No Background Support**

- **Problem**: Notifications only worked when the app was open
- **Solution**: Added a Service Worker (`public/sw.js`) for background notification support

### 3. **No Scheduling Mechanism**

- **Problem**: Only immediate notifications were possible
- **Solution**: Implemented proper scheduling with timeout management and recurring notifications

### 4. **No Error Handling**

- **Problem**: Notification failures weren't handled gracefully
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling and fallbacks

### 5. **No Settings Persistence**

- **Problem**: Notification settings weren't saved between sessions
- **Solution**: Added localStorage persistence for all notification settings
